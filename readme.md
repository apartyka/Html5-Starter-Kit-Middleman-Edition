#Html5 Starter Kit: Middleman Edition
**Pre-Release Version 0.9**


##Description
A combination of Resource's [HTML5 Starter Kit](http://stash.resource.com/projects/VCL/repos/resource-html5-starter-kit/browse) and [dannyprose's Middleman-HTML5BP-HAML](https://github.com/dannyprose/Middleman-HTML5BP-HAML) projects.

##General Notes
Holy hell, the scss compiles in the...css folder?! Yes. Shit's on auto, bro. Checkout the config.rb file for all the global project settings. Such as, localization, compression, pancake making, and general front-end goodness. Compass is also included as a default. If you don't want it just comment out the @import rule.

##Dependencies
- Install Ruby. Mac users are good to go already. [Windows users: get RubyInstaller](https://forwardhq.com/support/installing-ruby-windows)
- Install RubyGems. [Mac users go here](http://rubygems.org/pages/download)
- [Install Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com/getting-started/#toc_1)
- If you don't have the bundler gem already, you will need to install it. Run the following command in your terminal/console: "gem install bundler". Bundler handles all the gem dependencies defined in the project's Gemfile.
